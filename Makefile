# This makefile is not made by a pro, you might need to fix it.

# One thing to note is that elaboration is not necessary when using
# ghdl compiled with mcode, thus it has no dependencies in this file.
# If ghdl instead was compiled with GCC/LLVM then there will be an
# output file that should be involved in this file.
# See the documentation https://ghdl.github.io/ghdl/using/InvokingGHDL.html
# under elaboration and "With regard to the artifacts"

##### All variables you need to edit are moved here:

# Main design entity
PRIMARY_DESIGN = generic_clk_en_divider

# Add design files to this row (not test benches), expected to reside in hdl_design/ subfolder
DESIGN_FILES = $(PRIMARY_DESIGN).vhd

# Add all testbench-related file names on this row, expected to reside in testbench/ subfolder
TEST_BENCHES = $(PRIMARY_DESIGN)_tb.vhd

# Name of the testbench entity to simulate (the entity name, not the filename)
TOP_TESTBENCH = $(PRIMARY_DESIGN)_tb
